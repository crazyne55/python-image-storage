# python-image-storage
an ineffective script I made for storing images as text

# "img_to_str.py" 
this script was made back in 2017-2018 and was later edited in 2021 (I have no idea when exactly I made or edited the script).

What it *does*:
- converts any png named "input.png" into a text file in a very ineffective format

What it *doesn't*:
- literally anything else
